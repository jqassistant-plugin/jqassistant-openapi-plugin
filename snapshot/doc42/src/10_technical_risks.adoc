== Risks and Technical Debts

=== Parser

* Most Parsers directly interact with the XO/Store interface. At least important data (e.g. Properties/Schemas/...) should be wrapped by a resolver to be referenced later on

=== Testing

* Test cases use the same contract for most of the time. This eases the risk of cross-reference and not independent Tests.
* Some test contracts have references to other parts of the contract which are not independent.

=== JSON-Schema

* The `Resolver` Class holds a collection von String attributes describing how a reference String of ja OpenAPI contract looks like. The `JsonSchemaParser` as well as some test cases also hold similar attributes. Those attributes should be generalized and stored in one location.
* The Type determination is a switch case statement and defaults to a runtime exception. This should needs to be exchanged to an "unknown" node.
